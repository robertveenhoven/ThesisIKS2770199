"Warning: if iphone apps spontaneously loose data"RT @JoelBurns: Dear @Apple"…and only the first 23 images in my Photo Roll made it over? Seriously@apple why does #iPhone4 plus #iOS5 equal half the battery life?
@apple why isn't my iTunes updating? I just wanna update my iPhone to IOS5!!! Then iTunes says that it needs to update to do it. Then fails!
Now @apple won't let me use credit on @iTunes unless I have a credit card. Should have told me when I redeemed the cards. Sound fair to you?

90 minutes after being at 100% my iPhone 4 (post #ios5 upgrade) has lost 40% of its charge and the @apple store folks are out of ideas.
"So ""cutting the cord"" makes podcasts even harder to manage?!? No subscriptions! WTH"remember when people used to say ""flat the fuck out!!"" lol.. and their face while saying.... kindahow i feel about @apple"
In less than an hour my post- #iOS5 iPhone has gone from 100% to 73% battery charge and the @apple store folks have no solution for me :(
Well @apple seems 2b screwing #iphone 4s resellars. They still dont have 4s. Yet were promised. Similar 2 Ma Bell's monopolistic prctices?

"Waited in line for nothing"Dear @appleIt's been 24hrs since I reported @ups theft of my iPhone and @apple has done nothing. No return call as promised. Nothing.
"This does not bode well. After charging all nightHouston we have a problem!! My iPad has been restoring for 12+ hours after installing @apple IOS5. This can't be right....
#Siri went down for a little while last night. Come on @apple! Get your shit together on this launch!
